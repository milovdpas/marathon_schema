 * no reliable idea what that is: `request.url` is built from the container's
 * bind address, so a self-hosted deploy sent users to `http://0.0.0.0:80/…`
 * after signing in with Google. A relative Location sidesteps the question
 * entirely — the browser resolves it against the URL it actually asked for.
 *
 * RFC 7231 has allowed relative Location since 2014 and every browser follows
 * it. `safeReturnTo` already guarantees the path is same-origin.
